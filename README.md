Detecting Pneumonia through X-ray Images with Convolutional Neural Networks in Keras and Back-end Tensorflow

## What Files are What
<b>.jpeg:</b> These are some example images you can use really fast to check the model
IM-0001-0001 is the only one without Pneumonia

<b>.ipynb</b> Jupyter Notebook file that i used to create/test the Model

<b>.html</b> HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook that is mainly here to viewing purposes

<b>.h5</b> The trained model for detecting Pneumonia from Chest X-ray Images

<b>.py</b> Source code from Jupyter Notebook
